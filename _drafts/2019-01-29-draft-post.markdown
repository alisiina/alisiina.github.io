[^1]: I use the terms "machine learning" and "statistical learning" interchangebly.
[^2]: Another important "tradeoff" is called the Bias-Variance tradeoff. Read [this article](https://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html) for a comprehensive explanation.
[^3]: The "hat" on top of $\hat{f}$ means that it is an estimated value as opposed to the real value of $f$. This is standard math syntax.
